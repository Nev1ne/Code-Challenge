# Code-challenge
The code challenge had three challenges to work on to work on.
The first challenge was to create a student grade generator, the second one was to create a speed detector and the last challenge was to create a program that would calculate tax deductions and net salary.

All the projects were set up using javaScript and no license was used in the repository.
